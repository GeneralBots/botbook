# SOC 2 Type II Compliance

This guide covers General Bots' SOC 2 Type II compliance implementation, including security controls, audit logging, evidence collection, and compliance reporting.

## Overview

SOC 2 Type II is a security framework developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) that evaluates how organizations manage customer data based on five Trust Service Criteria:

1. **Security** - Protection against unauthorized access
2. **Availability** - System accessibility as agreed
3. **Processing Integrity** - Accurate and timely processing
4. **Confidentiality** - Protection of confidential information
5. **Privacy** - Personal information handling

General Bots implements controls across all five criteria to ensure enterprise-grade security.

## Compliance Reporting

### Generating Compliance Reports

```http
POST /api/compliance/reports
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "report_type": "soc2",
  "period_start": "2025-01-01",
  "period_end": "2025-03-31",
  "criteria": ["security", "availability", "confidentiality"]
}
```

|------|-------------|-----------|
| `soc2` | Full SOC 2 compliance report | Quarterly |
| `access_review` | User access review | Monthly |
| `vulnerability` | Vulnerability assessment | Weekly |
| `incident` | Security incident report | As needed |

### Evidence Collection

The compliance module automatically collects evidence for audit:

**User Access Evidence**

- Current user list with roles
- Permission assignment history
- Access review sign-offs

**Change Management Evidence**

- Deployment logs
- Configuration change records
- Approval workflows

**Security Evidence**

- Vulnerability scan results
- Penetration test reports
- Security training completion

### Exporting Evidence

```http
GET /api/compliance/evidence/export

### Incident Response Process

1. **Detection** - Automated monitoring or manual report
2. **Triage** - Classify severity, assign responder
3. **Containment** - Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication** - Remove threat
5. **Recovery** - Restore services
6. **Lessons Learned** - Post-incident review

### Incident Logging

```http

}
```

## Vendor Management

### Third-Party Risk Assessment

All vendors handling customer data undergo:

- Security questionnaire
- SOC 2 report review (if available)
- Contract review for security requirements
- Annual reassessment

### For Developers

1. **Follow secure coding standards** - No hardcoded secrets, input validation
2. **Use security modules** - SafeCommand, sql_guard, error_sanitizer
3. **Log security events** - Use audit logging for sensitive operations
4. **Handle errors properly** - Never expose internal details

### For Organizations

1. **Assign compliance owner** - Dedicated person for SOC 2
2. **Schedule regular audits** - Annual Type II assessment
3. **Train employees** - Security awareness program
