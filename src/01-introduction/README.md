      <div class="wa-time">09:00</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="wa-message bot">

## Coming From Executive Vision?

If you just read the [Executive Vision](../executive-vision.md), here's what to know:

1. **Everything in that feature table?** It's all included in the single `botserver` binary
2. **No configuration needed** — Bootstrap detects your system and sets everything up
3. **Start simple** — Run it, chat with it, then customize

The philosophy is: **get running first, understand later**.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2 recommended)
- **Disk Space**: ~2GB for botserver-stack
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Ports**: 8080 (web), 5432 (database), 9000 (storage)

No Docker required. No cloud accounts. No API keys to start.
